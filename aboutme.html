		<p><h5> Having spent most of my life in Boston, Massachusetts, I developed a passion for the urban environment at a young age. It was this admiration which prompted my move to New York City in the fall of 2017, where I began studying Journalism & Design at The New School.
		<p><h5> Writing and creating art has always been a significant part of my life, and I'm happy to finally share my thoughts and projects with you. </h5></p>
